Read about our exit strategy below ","body":"There is now only **24 hours left** to go to before our campaign closes! \r\n\r\nWe are thrilled to have raised over £490k from 130 investors! Don’t miss your chance to join them on this exciting journey to becoming the new face of men’s grooming. \r\n\r\nWe’re backed by some of the biggest names in venture capital and investment here in the UK, who see a clear opportunity for an exit and so, we hope Crowdcube investors also see that opportunity.\r\n\r\nOur ambition for scale is huge. We want to become the market leader in Europe for men’s grooming in the coming years and reach a size akin to that of McDonalds or Starbucks. With that in mind, we are aiming to provide investors with a return within the next 4-7 years.\r\n\r\nAs highlighted on slide 24 of the investor deck, there are a number of high profile acquisitions and IPOs in recent years that demonstrate the opportunity for the business if we achieve our objectives.\r\n\r\nPrivate equity funds are often attracted to large chains with a scalable, repeatable business model and a robust playbook to open and market their stores. For example, in 2019, Procuritas bought our Norwegian hair salon chain, Cutters, for just shy of £40m.\r\n\r\nA large network of stores could support the growth of a product range which may be of interest to a large consumer group on the hunt for acquisition. For example, Toni and Guy’s product range was previously purchased for $411m when they reached 400+ franchise stores around the world.\r\n\r\nAs the business grows beyond the UK, the best wait to raise further capital and conduct both acquisitions and franchising will likely be through an IPO. For example, personal care brand, The Honest Co. raised over $400m in their IPO in 2021.\r\n\r\nIt is our belief that any of these potential routes would provide the opportunity for investors to earn a significant multiple on their investment in this round. In terms of comparables, across a range of industries and examples, valuations at around 20-40 sites sat at around $50-100m, showing potential valuations we can reach in a short time period as we continue to expand. An interesting example is a 12 store coffee chain raising at a $151m valuation, showing the potential for a fast growing, scalable physical business.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nTeam Cutbox","author":"qrg2oV","is_subscribed":false,"is_liked":false,"subscribers_count":1,"likes_count":0,"comments_count":0,"reports_count":0,"created_by_representative":true,"media":[],"created_at":"2023-07-03T13:13:31+00:00","updated_at":"2023-07-03T13:13:31+00:00","deleted_at":null}],"meta":{"posts_count":15,"cursor":{"next":"6qaOZN","previous":null,"current":"dbkNZA","count":3,"total":15}}},"opportunity":{"id":"lKnKBq","entr_title":"Louis, Oz","enable_email_notification_on_pitch_investment":true,"primary_sector_id":0,"company":{"id":"bkMJjl","following":false,"name":"CUTBOX LIMITED","summary":null,"slug":"cutbox-barbers","marketplace_slug":"cutbox","marketplace_company_id":"bjMO9E","registered_company_name":"CUTBOX LIMITED","status":"trading","status_notes":null,"last_known_update":null,"images":[{"type":"logo","status":"live","src":"https://files-crowdcube-com.s3.amazonaws.com/company_images/14888/logo_imported_from_crunchbase_uoxo5phomdvvv27ovokr.png"},{"type":"cover_image","status":"live","src":null}],"website":"http://cutbox.co.uk","facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CutboxBarbers","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cutboxbarbers","twitter":null,"linkedin":"https://linkedin.com/company/cutbox","company_number":"12541816","company_industry":{"id":2,"name":"Apparel \u0026 accessories, home and personal","slug":"apparel-accessories-home-personal"},"growth_stage":null,"is_marketplace":true,"created_at":"2023-04-24 09:26:18","updated_at":"2023-06-12 14:35:56","funding_history":{}},"can_view":true,"status":"funded","dates":{"activated":"2023-06-09 13:41:14","funded":"2023-06-12 08:29:49","closed":"2023-07-05 00:15:06"},"hidden":false,"restricted":false,"pledges_only":false,"eis":"no","seis":"no","ir_pme":"no","product":"equity_share_price","name":"CUTBOX","description":"Cutbox is on a mission to become one of the dominant male grooming brands in the UK and Europe, providing high quality, affordable haircuts targeted at a mass market, enabled by our proprietary technology.
